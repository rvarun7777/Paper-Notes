# Deep Reinforcement Learning: An Overview

## Core Elements

### Value Function

#### DQN

*contributions:*

- experience replay and target network -> stablize value function training
- end-to-end RL approach, minimal domain knowledge required
- same algorithm, network and hyper-parameters perform well on many different tasks -> good generalization

#### double DQN
