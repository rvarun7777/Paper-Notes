# Deep Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences

## Abstract

- explore RL systems with (non-expert) human preferences between pairs of trajectory segments;
- run experiments on some RL tasks, namely Atari and MuJoCo, and show effectiveness of this approach;
- advantage: 1) no need to access to the reward function; 2) less than 1% feedback needed -> reduce the cost of human oversight; 3) can learn complex novel behaviors.
