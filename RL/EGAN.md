# Enhanced Experience Replay Generation for Efficient Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract

- *issue:* RL on real systems -> sparse and slow data sampling;
- *solution:* pre-train the agent with the EGAN;
- *performance:* ~20% improvement of training time in the beginning of learning compared to no pre-training; ~5% improvement and smaller variations compared to GAN pre-training.

## Introduction

5G telecom systems -> fufill ultra-low latency, high robustness, quick response to changed capacity needs, and dynamic allocation of functionality.

*Problems:*

1. exploration has an impact on the service quality in real-time service systems;
2. sparse and slow data sampling -> extended training duration.

## Enhanced GAN
